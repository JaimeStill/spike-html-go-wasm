## Decisions

- setup: one repository, one Go module, one Pages project site scaffolded from
  spike-html-hosting-sdk v0.6.1, laid out in Elemental layers (Go bridge, scenario composition
  roots and entrypoints, the web runtime, components, pages), with the check holding the web
  tiers' import direction by an ESLint boundaries table, as spike-html-apps did, and the Go
  direction by a `go list` test. Rejected: layer repositories; this spike settles Go WASM
  conventions, and the intake decides what moves to the SDK and documentation components layer.
- setup: standard Go 1.27.4 ships; TinyGo 0.44.0 builds the same demos as a comparison.
- setup: sizes are measured and reported, never gated; the spike focuses on capability and
  performance. Measured at setup (Go 1.27.4, `-s -w`): hello 706 KB gzip, the sqlate compile demo
  1.20 MB gzip, a bare net/http handler 1.61 MB gzip; Pages serves gzip, not brotli.
- setup: modules load only when the reader starts a demo.
- setup: one plain worker per page over the HTTP cache; the playground switches programs in place;
  Stop terminates the worker and reposts the compiled module to a fresh one. Measured in Chrome
  157: a cached reload downloads 0 B, compiles the wasm in ~66 ms and instantiates in ~7 ms; a
  warm compiler compiles hello in ~35 ms and links in ~170 ms. Rejected: SharedWorker with
  `extendedLifetime` (Chrome 148+ only; survived ≥40 s idle, gone by 70 s), a service worker
  (saves one 304 round trip; Pages sends max-age=600 + ETag), and storing the compiled module in
  IndexedDB (DataCloneError in Chrome 157).
- setup: the playground runs Go's own `cmd/compile` and `cmd/link` built to wasm in the worker,
  over an in-memory `globalThis.fs`, with the whole standard library plus sqlate, go-core, and
  go-web-sdk as per-package archives fetched per import through a manifest. Measured under node:
  compile + link + run of hello in 0.8 s; compiler 10.5 MB and linker 3.3 MB gzip; the Tour's
  imports 5.6 MB gzip of archives, the full standard library 33.6 MB. Rejected: the yaegi
  interpreter v0.16.3 (stdlib to go1.22, a generic Map fails, a 10M-step loop takes 4.1 s), the
  play.golang.org remote service (its terms ask for a unique user agent a page can't set), and
  GopherJS (pinned to go1.21).
- setup: under `GOOS=js`, GOMAXPROCS is 1: sleeps, channels, select, and mutexes behave as
  natively, but CPU work doesn't run in parallel and nothing preempts a busy loop, so Stop must
  terminate the worker.
- setup: Go scenarios: four programs of our own run from source in the playground (basics:
  structs, methods, function values, interfaces; generics: constraints, a generic type,
  range-over-func iterators; concurrency: goroutines, channels, select, WaitGroup, a pipeline,
  noting GOMAXPROCS 1; standard library: json, text/template, slices, regexp, errors.Is/As),
  beneath three workspace demos: sqlate (compile plus an in-process sqltest run), go-core graph,
  and go-web-sdk handlers called in-process. Rejected: porting A Tour of Go's lessons.
- setup: reusable components, Lit, `sl-` prefix, each one feature area: sl-code-editor,
  sl-file-tabs, sl-console, sl-run-controls, sl-timings, and sl-go-demo composing them over a
  runner the page passes in; no component imports the runtime.
- setup: the editor is `contenteditable="plaintext-only"` with Shiki 4.6.0 tokens painted as CSS
  Custom Highlight ranges, on the SDK's palette themes. Measured in Chrome 157: ~10 ms a keystroke
  on 296 lines; Enter, Tab via insertText, undo/redo, and IME held; exposed as a multiline
  textbox. Degrades: `::highlight` paints colour only, so Catppuccin and Everforest lose their
  italics; needs Firefox 140 and Safari 17.2, untested there. Rejected: a transparent textarea
  over a highlighted layer, and EditContext (Chrome only).
- setup: Markdown pages embed `<sl-go-demo scenario="…">` wrapping an ordinary go fence; the
  shell's entry defines the element on every page and loads Go only on demand. Works with SDK
  v0.6.1's markdownPages unchanged.
- setup: the evidence is the twelve items in `context/README.md`, "The evidence".
- setup: kind code, check `mise run check`, currency `mise run currency`, no gate, github remote,
  merge `gh pr checks --watch && gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`, and a `[remote] ci` that
  waits for the push run, the Pages deploy, as spike-html-hosting.
- setup: toolchain at init: go 1.27.4, node 26.13.0, pnpm 12.19.0, shellcheck 0.11.0, tinygo
  0.44.0; the site task adds the SDK's toolchain (Vite, typescript-go, ESLint, Prettier,
  actionlint, chrome-headless-shell).
- setup: references: sqlate, go-core, and go-web-sdk at their latest release when each task
  plans (graph-ergonomics is updating the Go stack; the architect flags a critical release);
  spike-html-hosting-sdk v0.6.1, -components v0.5.0, -icons v0.1.0, spike-html-apps-foundation
  v0.3.0, spike-html-apps-tooling v0.3.0, spike-html-hosting at 421254d, and spike-html-apps at
  dae9a77.

## Notes

- sqlate's own currency trails (pgx 5.12.0, golangci-lint 2.15.0, mise go 1.27.4); that belongs to
  the goal that next locks sqlate.
- spike-html-hosting-sdk's markdownPages has no hook for marked extensions; an intake candidate.
- A browser running a wasm build is another runtime layer; this spike's answer bears on the
  `elemental-runtime-layers` backlog goal.
